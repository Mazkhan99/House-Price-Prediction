# House-Price-Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices based on various factors using machine learning models. The user interface for this project is built using Shiny, an R package that allows the creation of interactive web apps directly from R. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data visualization tools, this app provides a user-friendly way to input house features and predict the corresponding price.

# üöÄ Features
- Interactive Web Application: Built using R's Shiny framework.
- Machine Learning Models: Uses models such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict house prices.
- Real-time Predictions: Users can input data to get predictions in real-time.
- Visualizations: Displays graphs and charts that help users understand the model performance.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- R: Programming language for statistical computing and data visualization.
- Shiny: Web framework for building interactive web applications in R.

# üéØ How to Use
- Load Dataset: The app allows users to load custom house price datasets or use the default one provided.
- Select Model: Choose a machine learning model from the options (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- Input House Features: Input house characteristics such as Square Footage, Year Built, Garage Size, etc.
- Get Prediction: Click on "Predict" to get the estimated house price.
- Visualizations: View graphs comparing predicted prices to actual prices, feature importance, and more.

# üìà Example Results
Here are some example predictions made by the models:

- Linear Regression:
 Predicted Price: $245,000
 Actual Price: $250,000
- Random Forest:
Predicted Price: $248,500
Actual Price: $250,000
